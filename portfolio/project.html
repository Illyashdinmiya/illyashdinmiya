        My name is Illyash Din Miya, and I was born on 2066-04-21 in the
        vibrant city of Pokhara, Nepal. Currently, I reside in Pokhara,
        although my early years were spent in the tranquil town of Dulegauda.
        I recently completed my Secondary Education Examination (SEE) from
        Panchamuni Dev Secondary School, where I pursued Education and
        Economics as my optional subjects. With a growing interest in
        Information and Technology, I have decided to further my knowledge in
        this field.
        Through my studies and hands-on experiences, I aim to become
        proficient in web development and explore various other facets of
        information technology.
