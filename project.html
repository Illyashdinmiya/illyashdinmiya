          My name is Illyash Din Miya, and I was born on 2066-04-21 in the
          vibrant city of Pokhara, Nepal. Currently, I reside in Pokhara,
          although my early years were spent in the tranquil town of Dulegauda.
          I recently completed my Secondary Education Examination (SEE) from
          Panchamuni Dev Secondary School, where I pursued Education and
          Economics as my optional subjects. With a growing interest in
          Information and Technology, I have decided to further my knowledge in
          this field. During the three-month holiday following my SEE exams, I
          enrolled in a teaching institute specializing in web development. This
          opportunity allows me to dive deeper into the world of technology,
          acquiring essential skills that I hope to use in shaping my future
          career. My journey in web development has been both challenging and
          rewarding, and I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.
          Living in Pokhara, I am inspired by the city's blend of natural beauty
          and technological advancement. This motivates me to harness the power
          of technology to contribute positively to my community and beyond.
          Through my studies and hands-on experiences, I aim to become
          proficient in web development and explore various other facets of
          information technology.
